## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 for structuring the CV content.
- CSS3 with Flexbox for layout and styling.
- JavaScript for interactive elements (e.g., theme switching, generating PDF).
- Boxicons for icons.
- html2pdf.js for PDF generation.

### What I learned

During this project, I enhanced my skills in:

- Responsive Design: I used Flexbox and CSS techniques to create a layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- PDF Generation: I integrated html2pdf.js to allow users to download the CV as a PDF directly from the page.
- Interactive Features: I implemented JavaScript-based functionalities like theme switching and a button to generate the PDF, which improved the usability of the site.
